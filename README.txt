This is an attempt at the fannkuch-redux algorithm for shootout.alioth.debian.org. Fannkuch-redux is the only benchmark that is missing a Racket implentation at the time of writing (14th March 2012). 
Note: main file is currently 'pfannkuchen.rkt' but final version will be 'pfannkuchen-single-file.rkt' (where all code will be in the one file).
